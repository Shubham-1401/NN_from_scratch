# NN_from_scratch
Implemented an artificial neural network on MNIST dataset using only numpy, pandas and math.
The training and test datasets can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data
the final accuracy for test set comes out to be *86.19%*. For a neural network implemented from scratch with only 1 hidden layer, I think it performed very well.
The final output can be improved by tuning parameters such as alpha and number of iterations for gradient descent. Increasing number of neurons and number of hidden layers will definitely improve the performance.
